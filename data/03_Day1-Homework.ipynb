An enormous amount of resources, both human and machine, have exhausted countless hours analyzing $\\pi$'s decimal contributions, and roughly 100 trillion digits of $\\pi$ are known today.

The key to approximating $\\pi$ is generating coordinate pairs of random numbers, which correspond to (x,y) positions inside of the square, and counting how many land inside the circle. With a statistically large random sample of coordinate pairs, the ratio of points landing inside the circle to total number of points approximates the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area. This is known as the stone throwing problem and is mathmatically formulated as:<br/>\n",

Note that all generated points should land within the square, such that $N_{total}=N_{square}$. Using a little geometry, $A_{circle}=\\pi (\\frac{D}{2})^2$ and $A_{square}=D^2$, the final relation for $\\pi$ is given as:<br/>\n",
