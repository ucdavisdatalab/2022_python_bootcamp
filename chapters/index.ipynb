        "This two-day course is designed to prepare incoming (or experienced) graduate students and post docs with little to no coding experience for the coding demands that many graduate courses and research often requires. In the past this training was fully run by graduate students held over zoom or in a random classroom. This is our second year we have teamed up with the UC Davis Data lab, who have offered their assistance in running the workshop and providing space for the workshop to take place. With that being said this intensive training is still majorly put together and run by graduate students and post docs aimed to help other graduate students and post docs. The intensive training will take place over October 23rd - 24th from 5 pm - 8 pm with limited seating on campus in the Shields 360 (DataLab classroom) as well as on Zoom for those who don't obtain a spot for in person. This is a great opportunity to learn a new skill and meet other graduate students! Each session will begin with about an hour of demonstration to teach fundamental Python topics. This will be followed by time where students can work on an assignment with each other and ask questions to volunteers. The assignment each day will cover the topics learned in the session that day!"
