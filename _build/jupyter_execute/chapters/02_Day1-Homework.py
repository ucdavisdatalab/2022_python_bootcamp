# # **Day 1 Homework**

# Here is a [csv file](data/Day1Counteryinfo2018.csv) that contains all of the countires that competed in the 2018 Winter Olympic games and their latitudes and longitudes. 

# ## Initial Intructions:

# 
# 
# 1.   Download the csv file from the link above.
# 2.   Open a new [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/) and click on "New Notebook" in the corner.
# 3.   Click the file icon on the left toolbar, then click on the upload icon (the button on the left).
# 4.   Choose the new .csv file to upload in order to import the data.
# 5.   Here’s the actual homework!
# 
# 

# # Assignment

# 
# 
# *   Open the csv file and examine what’s in it. What variable types are in here? Strings, floats, or integers?
# *   In your empty Colab notebook, write a script that imports the data from the file and makes a scatter plot.
#     *   The `with open()` command demonstrated in lecture may be helpful.
# *   Try to add the equator as well if you can. (Hint: the [plt.hlines()](https://matplotlib.org/stable/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.hlines.html) function may be useful.)
# *   The plot should somewhat look like a map of the world. Unfortunately Africa’s representation at the Winter Olympics is quite low (partially due to the climate) so there are few countries there.
# *    If you have time, attempt to add axis labels and a title as demonstrated in the lecture.
# *   Congrats! You are all done.
